How to adress death in a multiplayer game?

Well there are few ways of doing so.

First and foremost, respawning with some degree of penalty, 
and I dont mean fulldrop here, that is not a death penalty, because it does not work as penalty for those 
whom have nothing to loose.

Penalty can be 
Time or resource based or both,
a) take WoW example, player have to run to corpse to respawn.
b) In EVE you want to renew your clone and play N amount of money for it to be sutained
c) Star Wars Galaxies, you have to find a player healer and wait a bbit for healing to end, 
after which you can pay said healer (and if you dont, you will be written down into blacklist and might not get healed ever again)

Now the other way to do it is to introduce certain permadeath to a degree.
In eve way it would be, you lose your characcter and it doesnt have a new clone, you lost time and resources you spent on upping your skills.
In classical sense, you ded, you cry.
In some convoluted way it can be implemented in an interesting and working ways, substituing for loss of resources and time but with a more higher severe values and time constrains.
