So the pvp

Putting the combat system aside, as it's more of a different topic, lets look at pvp as whole.
Now what to make of it?
Obviously with full drop, most people's reasoning would be to kill anyone on sight, 
UNLESS there is some system of punishment which gives them severe disadvantage of leading bandit life for the sake of gain. 
Now that would not stop the pvp players who do it just for the sake of shooting everyone, 
but it will make them feel way less safer and welcome in wasteland.

So yes, the general idea right now is to introduce a thing where game checks whom shot first at whom,

Now not just that, we also add diffirence between Outlaw type, so to speak, and non outlaw for the lack of better terms.
Outlaws are essentially, become permadeath characters. Not only that, they also become shot on sight in towns,
and depending on bounty on their head and their proximity to a city, can be hunted by a NPC bounty hunters, not to mention players.

Players have a special stat tracking Outlaw progression, which can NEVER or VERY slowly raised in time, 
by reacing certain point, player becomes Outlaw and can never clean that status off. Perhaps there will be ways for players to
stay incognito in towns, but that would be very risky, anyhow.

So as to the checks of whom shot first at whom
Take person A and B
In case 1 person A is bandit, and B is not.
B shoots A first, B gets no penalty points.
A shoots B first, A gets penalty points and the bounty for his head is being raised.

In case 2, person A and B are not bandits.
B shoots A first, B gets poitns and vice versa.

In case 3, both are bandits.
They don't get their bounty up, but they might get recognition points or someshit at bandit hideout. Too early to speak of all detaisl atm.

That's the basics of PVP thing in game as of now I can think of.
