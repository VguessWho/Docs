How to make full drop but at same time to promote players to buy items from shops instead of farming them?

Well perhaps instead of making weapons and armors spawn on killed mobs, 
the broken version of armors and weapons will spawn on those said mobs after their death 
with % chance of spawning not too broken item, depending on cause of death and etc
And to get caps players either do jobs + scavenging (this is gonna be separate category here).
The broken items themselves will be useless but again, can be take apart for materials. 
So essentially instead of mobs giving players gear, players gonna have to buy it from npc traders or player crafters or craft it themselves

Hmmm?
