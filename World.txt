Well, the main idea for the Map, aswell as quests and overall mechanics is to create a seamless word.
To elaborate, is to say that there shouldn't be any part of the map which a player has an exclusive access compared to other players.
That, plus removal of a safe heavens and possibly the dissapearing PC characters will perhaps provide a more friendly setting for players,
but it is not the main goal of it. THE main goal of such concept would be to make the game less of a themepark and more of an actual beliveable world.
